They have a much lower chance to perform ghost events, For every 1% of average sanity lost, ghost event chance is increased by 2% (starting with 0% change at 100% sanity). A Shade can't start a hunt if a player is nearby. \n\nThe Shade prefers to do the airball event. **(p.airball)**, also it prefers to be in the shadow form during ghost events. \n\nCan Hunt at 35% Sanity.",
