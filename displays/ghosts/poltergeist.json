    "ability": "**A Poltergeist can throw multiple objects at once.** \nThis is called a multithrow, and it drains sanity. \nA multithrow will make some loud noise, and the activity chart in the van will show a short and tall spike. 2% sanity drain per object thrown of all players around the ghost"
