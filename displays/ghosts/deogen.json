    "trait": "**You can __NOT HIDE__ from this ghost** \n \nThe deogen is extremely fast if it can not see you, but if it has line of sight of you, it will move very slowly. \n \nThis means **you have to loop the ghost** during a hunt. \n \nYou can't get the Deogen till you're Prestige0-Level30 \n\nCan Hunt at 40% Sanity. Does not speed up over time in LoS.",
