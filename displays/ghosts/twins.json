    "trait": "**The Twins are 2 ghosts!** \nOne real ghost, that will be normal, and one \"fake ghost\". \nThe fake ghost can do ghost events, interactions, and hunts, but it will not lower the temperatures of any rooms, and the only evidence you can get from the fake ghost is EMF Level 5. It can't step in salt or trigger a motion sensor!\n \n**While hunting, the normal ghost will have 90% of normal speed,** \nwhilst the fake ghost will have 110% of normal speed, making it slightly faster. \nThe fake ghost has lower chance to hunt \n\nCan Hunt at 50% Sanity.",
    "ability": "**The Twins can interact with 2 different objects** \nat 2 different locations, 1 second apart. \n This will cause a special form of activity shown on the Activitychart (1 of 2 types, See Picture below).  \nSeeing this multiple times? Maybe you are dealing with the Twins! :)"
